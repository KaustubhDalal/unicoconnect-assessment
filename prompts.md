This document lists the AI prompts I used throughout the Event Check-in & Ticketing assessment. These prompts helped me clarify requirements, design architecture, write documentation, and fix bugs.

## Understanding Requirements & Planning

- "Explain the MVP features and key functionalities required for a one-day event management app with attendee registration, check-in, notifications, and exports."

- "What are the typical third-party integrations recommended for sending email notifications in an event registration system?"

- "Suggest a high-level project roadmap for implementing an event check-in system with frontend, backend, and export features."

## Architecture & Design

- "Generate a detailed architecture overview for a full-stack event management app using React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, SQLite database, image upload, and JWT authentication."

- "Provide a system flow diagram and component breakdown for an event check-in app with image upload and CSV export."

- "How to serve static uploaded images from Express backend so that frontend can load them by URL?"

- "Help to generate PDF format to show qr code and other required data"

---

## Documentation & Other Files

- "Create a professional README.md with project overview, tech stack, installation steps, and usage instructions."
